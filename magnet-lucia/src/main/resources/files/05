There is really no such thing as a post-apocalyptic story. Someone, after all, has to survive to tell the tale. An apocalypse must be incomplete to be interesting: cockroaches don‚Äôt present much opportunity for character development.

And yet, this is how we sometimes talk about climate change: we‚Äôre doomed, the apocalypse is coming, the end of the world is nigh. Don‚Äôt get me wrong: climate change is an overwhelmingly horrific thing. It will lead‚Äîit already is leading- to massive economic damage, desperate refugees, and the loss of things we love. But it‚Äôs fundamentally different from an asteroid impact or zombie plague, and I think it‚Äôs important to understand why.

I do understand the urge to catastrophize. My last name is Marvel, and if you make a joke about its resemblance to a certain mass entertainment conglomerate, you will definitely be the first person to ever do so. But to support the family business, I‚Äôve seen a fair number of superhero movies, and I understand the stakes are high. Movie supervillains are never trying to make sweeping changes to the tax code or reform the regulatory state. They‚Äôre trying to destroy the entire universe and murder every single one of the good guys. The assumption seems to be that audiences simply won‚Äôt care about anything less that total destruction.

I believe that it is possible to care about something without believing it will destroy all life in the universe. I know my own personal bar is set substantially lower. But it‚Äôs true: climate change is a unique problem, and it‚Äôs incredibly hard to talk about. I think there are three reasons for this.

First, climate change isn‚Äôt a supervillain. It‚Äôs worse. Villains, after all, clearly explain the havoc they‚Äôre about to cause, usually to the hero they‚Äôve just captured. If only our climate projections could provide such certainty. Unfortunately, sometimes the best information scientists can provide comes hedged with caveats. For example, under current emissions trajectories we might exceed the two degree warming limit set by the Paris Climate Agreement as soon as the 2030s, or as much as a generation into the future. What should we do with this information? This uncertainty can lead to paralysis and confusion. Humans are terrible at thinking about probabilities, as every weather forecaster on the receiving end of abuse for being ‚Äúwrong‚Äù well knows.

Second, the climate apocalypse will not come for us all, at least not all at oncTrump framed his decision to pull the US from the landmark Paris climate agreement as ‚Äúa reassertion of America‚Äôs sovereignty‚Äù, adding he was ‚Äúelected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.‚Äù

He said the US could try to re-enter the deal under more favourable terms or work to establish ‚Äúan entirely new transaction‚Äù ‚Äì but indicated that it would hardly be of high priority. ‚ÄúIf we can, great. If we can‚Äôt, that‚Äôs fine,‚Äù he said.

As my colleague David Smith reported earlier, the White House says America will follow the lengthy exit process outlined in the deal, meaning it will remain in the agreement (at least formally) for another three-and-a-half years ‚Äì taking us right up to the next presidential election in November 2020.

Though the US will remain part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Trump declared: ‚ÄúAs of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris accord.‚Äù

That includes contributions to the UN Green Climate Fund (to help poorer countries to adapt to climate change and expand clean energy) and reporting on carbon data (though that is required in the US by domestic regulations anyway).

In a joint statement, the leaders of France, Germany and Italy responded to Trump‚Äôs decision ‚Äúwith regret‚Äù, but said the Paris agreement could not be renegotiated.

The question now becomes what efforts, if any, the US will adopt towards tackling climate change on its own terms ‚Äì and whether the nearly 200 countries that remain in the deal will amend their own obligations.

The US is the world‚Äôs second-largest emitter of carbon, behind only China ‚Äì which, along with India, was singled out by Trump as being favoured under the Paris deal. But both Beijing and New Delhi have reaffirmed their commitment to meeting their targets.

Trump is currently reviewing major US regulations on power plants and car rules that are aimed at reducing carbon emissions. The US Conference of Mayors, which strongly opposed his decision, said its members would continue efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming at the city and state level.

Speaking of full-page advertisements ‚Äì one placed in the New York Times in December 2009 has been doing the rounds on Twitter today.

It was signed by business leaders and liberal commentators, lobbying then-president Barack Obama, bound for Copenhagen to forge a global climate pact, to ‚Äúlead the world by example.

Among them ‚Äì and the reason why it‚Äôs resurfaced ‚Äì was Donald Trump and his three adult children. More here, from 2016, on Salon. Social media never forgets...

In separate statements and messages on social media, leaders of Apple, Google, Twitter, Amazon, Facebook, Tesla, Microsoft and IBM declared climate change an ‚Äúurgent‚Äù threat that required a global effort to combat.

Microsoft was among more than two dozen companies to publish an open letter urging Trump to remain in the accord as an advertisement in several US newspapers as part of an 11th-hour push on Thursday morning.

Trump‚Äôs decision signals the US‚Äô intention to increase emissions, which are already fast approaching the 2C band considered crucial by scientists to prevent serious damage to the planet.

This clock estimates how much greenhouse gas the world is emitting right now ‚Äì and how much we have left to emit if we want to avoid catastrophic climate change. In just 24 hours, the world will pump out more than 112m tons (CO2-e).

White House will not say whether Trump denies climate change
David Smith David Smith
The White House has declined to say whether Donald Trump believes human activity contributes to climate change as the president pulled America out of the Paris agreement.

Administration officials were also unable to offer revised US carbon emission targets or say what changes to the global landmark accord would persuade Trump to re-enter it. But they did offer assurance that America will abide by the lengthy exit process outlined in the deal, waiting three-and-a-half years to formally withdraw.

Here‚Äôs some Conservative reaction on social media to the US‚Äô withdrawal from the Paris accord ‚Äì it seems conviction in the unfairness of the deal has only been bolstered by condemnation of Trump‚Äôs decision.

Newt Gingrich
(@newtgingrich)
Every foreign leader attacking Pres Trump over leaving Paris Accord -further proof the deal was one sided and better for foreigners than USe. A large body of research demonstrates that the people who will suffer the most from a changing climate will be those who did the least to cause it. Wealth may still buy security, even in a warmer, more chaotic world.

Finally, a climate apocalypse may well be on the way, but it competes for attention with our own personal apocalypses. At the risk of this column resembling a Smiths song, I would like to point out that we all, eventually, are going to die. I would prefer not to, of course. And perhaps by the time I am elderly we will have developed sufficiently advanced technology to become immortal. But I think I would probably prefer the sweet embrace of death to spending eternity with the kind of tech billionaires who could afford it.

The point is, climate change is staggeringly fast on geological timescales, and relatively slow in comparison to a human lifetime. Given the poverty, racism, and inequality in the world, climate change is seldom anyone‚Äôs number one problem. Until, one day, it is.

But there are reasons to be optimistic. We make vital decisions under uncertainty all the time. There was a 50 percent chance of rain on my wedding day, but I couldn‚Äôt choose to get half married. And we can understand the unfairness that climate change will exacerbate, and work toward a more just society. Finally, we have the tools‚Äîscience, policy, technology‚Äîand the creativity to imagine a better world that outlasts our own lifetimes.

Look, I hate to break it to you: we are doomed. That has nothing to do with climate change, and everything to do with the simple fact of being alive. But we have a choice about what to do to this wonderful place we inhabit for a short, miraculous time.

I don‚Äôt think climate change will destroy the actual planet or make the human species go extinct. But, you know what? I believe we can aim for something a little bit better than ‚Äúnot doomed.‚Äù If, at the end of the day, the most positive thing I can note in my diary is ‚ÄúFAILED TO GO EXTINCT,‚Äù then that was probably not a good day. There is space for action between ‚Äúeverything is fine‚Äù and ‚Äúwe‚Äôre doomed.‚Äù That space is shrinking fast, but the gap is not closed yet. It shouldn‚Äôt take an apocalypse to make us do the right thing.
